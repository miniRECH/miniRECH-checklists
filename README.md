# miniRECH-checklists

A collection of checklists for assessing the quality of methods reporting in selected bio-medical fields.

In the top level directory, you'll find a number of checklists that have already been specialised for use in different domains.

In the 'myMiniRECH' directory, you'll find the blank checklist, as an Excel spreadsheet containing Visual Basic macros.  An instruction document, showing how to go about customising the blank spreadsheet for another domain, is also present in this directory.

If you make use of the checklists, we would appreciate it if you could send us a reference to any papers published that miniRECH helped or hindered.  We are always happy to receive constructive criticism, through (e.g.) the issue tracker on this site.
